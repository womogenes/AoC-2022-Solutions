# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)!

I'm making videos that explain my solutions to the puzzles! Watch my playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqh-jhhTL2-cJiIRlju1sQj0i_Sk9zmd


## Structure

Days' code are contained in `/day_xx` and source files are named `day_xx_px`.


## Requirements

I'm experimenting around with being more efficient this year, so I'm going to use the [`advent-of-code-data`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) library by [Wim Glenn](https://github.com/wimglenn) to streamline the data retrieval and submission process. Therefore, if you'd like to run my code, install `advent-of-code-data` with
```
pip install advent-of-code-data
```
first.
